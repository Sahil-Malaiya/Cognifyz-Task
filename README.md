Overview
This repository is part of my internship at Cognifyz. The tasks are divided into multiple levels, with increasing complexity as I progress. Below is an overview of my current progress:<br>

Level 1: All tasks successfully completed. ðŸŽ‰
Level 2: To be started soon.
Level 3: Yet to begin.
Each task is implemented in Java and includes:

Problem descriptions.
Sample input/output.
Key features.
Challenges and learnings.
Level 1: Completed Tasks
1. Temperature Converter
Description:
This program converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The user inputs a temperature value and the unit of measurement (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The program then converts it to the other unit and displays the result.<br>

Features:

Supports both Celsius-to-Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversions.
Validates input to ensure accurate calculations.
Sample Run:

Enter temperature value: 100
Enter unit (C/F): C
Converted temperature: 212.0 F
Key Learnings:

Handling user input effectively.
Working with conditionals for different units.
2. Palindrome Checker
Description:
A program to check whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. It ignores spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.
<br>
Features:

Handles case-insensitive comparisons.
Ignores spaces and non-alphanumeric characters.
Supports single words and phrases.
Sample Run:

Enter a word or phrase: A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
The input is a palindrome!
Key Learnings:

String manipulation techniques.
Handling edge cases, like spaces and punctuation.
3. Student Grade Calculator
Description:
This program calculates the average grade for a student. The user specifies the number of grades, inputs each grade, and the program computes the average.

Features:

Validates grade input to ensure values are between 0 and 100.
Displays all grades entered and the calculated average.
Sample Run:

Enter the number of grades to be entered: 3
Enter grade 1: 85
Enter grade 2: 90
Enter grade 3: 78

Grade Summary:
Grade 1: 85.0
Grade 2: 90.0
Grade 3: 78.0
Average Grade: 84.33
Key Learnings:

Working with arrays to store multiple inputs.
Validating numerical input effectively.
4. Random Password Generator
Description:
This program generates a random password based on user preferences, such as desired length and inclusion of numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.
<br>
Features:

Fully customizable password generation (length, character types).
Ensures at least one character type is selected.
Validates password length input.
Sample Run:

Enter the desired length of the password: 12
Should the password include numbers (0-9)? true
Should the password include lowercase letters (a-z)? true
Should the password include uppercase letters (A-Z)? true
Should the password include special characters (!@#$%^&*)? true

Generated Password: aB2!zX@4#Lm$
<br>
Key Learnings:

Building character pools dynamically based on user input.
Using the Random class to ensure randomness.
Validating user preferences and ensuring robust error handling.
Next Steps: Preparing for Level 2
As I move to Level 2, I aim to:

Review Feedback: Incorporate suggestions and improvements for Level 1 tasks.
Anticipate Advanced Requirements: Extend existing solutions, such as:
Adding a GUI or file-handling capabilities.

Improving program efficiency and scalability.
Organize Code: Maintain a clean and modular structure for each task.<br>
